/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for CapUpdate Manager
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset employs a hybrid security model:
 *   - Public read access to application definitions.
 *   - Owner-only access to user profiles and saved applications.
 * @data_structure
 *   - /applications/{applicationId}: Stores publicly readable application definitions.
 *   - /users/{userId}: Stores private user profile data.
 *   - /users/{userId}/saved_applications/{savedApplicationId}: Stores user-specific saved applications, accessible only by the owning user.
 * @key_security_decisions
 *   - Applications are publicly readable but require a password for updates. This allows broad access to application information while preventing unauthorized modifications.
 *   - User listing is disallowed.
 *   - Saved applications are strictly controlled through path-based ownership.
 * @denormalization_for_authorization
 *   - Path-based ownership in /users/{userId}/saved_applications/{savedApplicationId} eliminates the need for `get()` calls to verify ownership. The `userId` in the path *is* the owner.
 * @structural_segregation
 *   - Applications, being publicly readable, are stored in a top-level collection separate from user-specific data.
